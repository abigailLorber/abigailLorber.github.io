## Assignment

This assignment was from my Computer Science 1 class at Hawai'i Pacific University. The Caesar cipher is an encryption technique where each letter is replaced by another letter that is a fixed number of positions away in the alphabet. The Caesar cipher can easily be decrypted and offers no secuirty, but it is incorporated in some more complex ciphers. When creating this program, I was able to gain a better understanding of encryption techniques and was introduced to encryption.

This was an independent assignment and we were asked to create a program that prompts the user to enter a message, along with a key. The program should then print the Caesar cipher encrypted message.
