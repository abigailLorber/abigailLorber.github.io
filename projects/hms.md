The HMS (Hotel Management System) was developed in order to keep track of different customers checking in and out of a hotel establishment.

The HMS allows a user to choose between 6 different options:
  1. Manage rooms
  2. Check-in rooms
  3. Available rooms
  4. Search Customer
  5. Check-out rooms
  6. Guest Summary Report

An excerpt from the HMS is provided below.
