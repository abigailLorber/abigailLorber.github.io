## What I Am Currently Interested In

I am in a student internship program, and next semester I will be working instead of school (I alternate semesters of work/school). I will be doing full-stack development, and I believe what I learn out of this semester, especially in ICS 314 (Software Engineering 1), will benefit me a lot when I go back to work. I'm looking forward to learning a lot from ICS 314, but one thing I am seeking out of this class is efficiency and connectivity. I want to learn how to make my programs more efficient and I want to improve my understanding of how programs interact with each other. I am also looking forward to the HTML/CSS portion of ICS 314, I have some experience using those languages, so it will be fun to revisit languages that I can brush up on.

## What I Hope to Learn in the Future

In a semester or two, I plan on taking game development courses at UH MƒÅnoa. I have no experience with game development and I want to learn more becasue it has always interested me. I would like to get into 3D modeling and environment creation, I have no idea how to do either, but I enjoy being creative and crafty. 

I have some experience using Git and Docker, but I would like to improve on them in the future. I have a limited understanding of containerization and Docker has been tricky for me to grasp. On the other hand, I am getting better at using Git and familiarizing myself with the plethora of Git commands, but this is only the beginning for me and I have so much more to learn. None of the courses I have taken so far have gone over Docker or Git, and I hope that the classes I take these next few semesters will start to introduce these concepts.
