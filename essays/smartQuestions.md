## The Importance of Smart Questions

Asking questions in a "smart" way is significant because people need to understand what is being asked in order to help find a solution. It also allows the solution to be found faster because if you're communicating effectively, people won't have to puzzle together what is being asked, which could cause annoyance and avoidance of the question altogether. Asking questions in a *concise* way is also important. No one wants to spend 15 minutes reading a wall of text and code that could have been condensed into a 30 seconds read. Speaking of walls of code, I came across one post on StackOverflow that had a snippet of code attached that was a whopping *139* lines long (yes, I pasted it into a text editor to find out...). I don't know if that even deserves to be called a snipped of code since they essentially put their whole program. The OP was having issues with their JavaScript program because they tried assigning the `id` attribute to multiple elements. They were hit with a "Use a `class` attribute instead [of] `id`, rtfm!". Overall, the post was poorly written and the code "snippet" was excessively long, also OP seemed to do very little research about the issue that they were having.

I found a different StackOverflow post that also asked a "simple" question that could be googled, but was met with the complete opposite response, and was upvoted over 6,000 times. The OP stated that they tried figuring out what the difference between the `let` and `var` keywords, but still quite couldn't understand. The most upvoted answer gave a in-depth explanation on all the different ways that the `let` and `var` keyword are different. Overall, this question was asked in a "smart" way because the question was simple, and they also stated that they did do some previous research because they included a link to a website explaining `let` and `var`. While this poster did their research and was still having a tough time understanding the concept, the other poster mentioned above seemed to do no research about their issue. Additionally, the post was written well; the grammar was better than the other StackOverflow post that I mentioned earlier.
