I have never used TypeScript before ICS 314, but I have used JavaScript in high school. I think the syntax is annoying and a little more difficult to learn than Python or Golang, for example. I tried to learn some Rust once, and nothing will ever be as bad as that - so I guess TypeScript has that going for itself.

I think my biggest issue with TypeScript is that I often find myself just programming in JavaScript. I do think that safety would be more of a problem in projects that are larger and have a lot of contributors, and TypeScript would be great at solving this issue. TypeScript also seems to be a decent programming language because you have to declare data types, which can be helpful in cases where the code base is huge. But, I would probably not use TypeScript for something small or personal projects.

## My Issue With WODs

In terms of athletic software engineering, I don’t like it. The weekly “WODs”, or Workouts Of the Day are not enjoyable, specifically because they are timed. The practice WODs have been fine so far, but I am terrified for the “real” WODs. I would prefer to do Kattis problems (similar to Leetcode), and stay comfortable by having unlimited time. But I guess a lot of ICS 314 will push me out of my comfort zone and challenge me, which may not necessarily be a bad thing.
