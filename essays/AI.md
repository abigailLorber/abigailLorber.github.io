So many people use AI throughout there day. I don't really use AI a lot, but I primarily use it to summarize notes or explain concepts that I am struggling to understand. I know that some people in the ICS 314 class used AI and I think it seemed to help them. I considered using it to see what it could do, but I ended up not using it because I felt like a lot of concepts were well explained on the website. I think using AI tools to check code and look for any errors is a good idea, but I also didn't do this because I just relied on our use of ESLint to check for errors/coding standards. I think it was cool that the Professors allowed the students to use AI tools because I feel like in the 'real world', people are allowed to use AI tools at work. I never used GitHub Copilot, but I have heard good things from it. 

I didn't use AI throughout this course because I wanted to learn the concepts throught the course material on the website. I didn't want to rely on AI tools, like ChatGPT, to explain concepts to me - especially because I felt like I had enough material to learn the concepts on my own. I also felt like if I used ChatGPT throughout the course, I would rely on it and not grasp concepts 100%. So I guess I felt like the struggle of not understanding stuff sometimes was good because it challenged me to look at problems in a different way. Additionally, I feel like ChatGPT and other AI tools sometimes are wonky and don't understand what people are asking it, so I feel like it's not super reliable. I think it explains some concepts well, but other times it struggles.
