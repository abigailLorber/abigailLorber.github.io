- very easy for collaboration and when multiple people are working on the same code base
- helps with indentation
- formatting
- helps learn the programming language, w.out formatting some exceptions may be made that wouldn't be allowed with a code formatter.
- keeps things organized, great for perfectionists.


I think naming conventions is also important (camelCase vesus _ between each words), makes it easier to read code also more satisfying in my opinion
