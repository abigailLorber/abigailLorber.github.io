<!--
I, on the other hand, think that if you can only implement one software engineering technique to improve quality, it should be coding standards. Indeed, I believe some coding standards can actually help you learn a programming language. Do you agree?

After your first week of using ESLint with VSCode, what are your impressions? Are you finding that getting rid of all the ESLint errors is painful, or useful, or both, or something else entirely?

Write an interesting, informative essay on coding standards that addresses some or all of the above questions, or goes in a different direction entirely regarding coding standards. Make sure it provides your personal perspective and useful insights.

## Coding Standards

I believe coding standards should be implemented regularly. It makes collaboration on projects very helpful and easy; when multiple people are working on the same code base, coding standards make the formatting so much nicer and cleaner looking. It is also helpful to have coding standards in place so that everyone is on the same page. For example, when naming variables, it keeps code more consistent and organized if everyone decided on a style, like using camelCase or snake_case. 

#ESLint

I think ESLint is a great formatter and have been thoroughly enjoying using it. I find myself not having too many issues with it, and the errors I do have are usually very fixable and easy. I 

- helps with indentation
- formatting
- helps learn the programming language, w.out formatting some exceptions may be made that wouldn't be allowed with a code formatter.
- keeps things organized, great for perfectionists.


I think naming conventions is also important (camelCase vesus _ between each words), makes it easier to read code also more satisfying in my opinion
