## Introduction

Some concepts that I have learned from taking Software Engineering that I know will help me in future courses and beyond are: coding standards, design patterns, and ethics in software engineering. I have learned a lot throughout this semester, and this course contributed to a lot of learning... and a lot of struggles. Learning about the above three concepts was really fun and intriguing to me, but I also really liked taking Software Engineering 1 because I enjoy HTML/CSS and I got a lot of enjoyment out of using Bootstrap and React. I think that the flexibility to create interactive, and appealing websites/applications is very fun and I feel like I learned a lot this semester, but there is still so much more for me to learn!

## Coding Standards

<br>

<br>

Coding standards was one concept that I felt like I really enjoyed learning about because of the organization it provides. I also really liked learning about this module because I believed that this could be applied outside of Software Engineering. Coding Standards are rules that developers follow to keep code cleaner and more organized. It is a practice implemented to standardize code, making it more readable, organized, and even efficient. By implementing coding standards, developers can find issues faster. Otherwise, it could take much longer to find issues. Coding standards are a diverse ruleset, for example - indentation spacing, naming conventions (variables, classes, etc.), commenting, structure of code, and much more! This was one of the most interesting modules to me because I am excited to implement this outside of Software Engineering, and I believe that developers use this quite often in their day-to-day.

When working on the final project, it became evident to me how people see things and work differently, which isn't a bad thing, but coding standards really helped with some disorganization. Soon, our code base became huge and the program wasn't very cohesive. But, after implementing coding standards, like ESLint, it provided us with organization that we desperately needed. Everything was more put together and efficient with coding standards: indentations looked better, spacing between functions was much more satisfying and put together. Overall, this module was one of my favorites because of how much assistance implementing this mindset can be. Even though this module isn't important in the sense that we didn't really learn about programming concepts people would typically think about, I think that this module was incredibly important because of how much time/energy can be saved using coding standards. Additionally, it makes programs look nicer and more professional.

## Design Patterns

<br>

<br>

Another concept that I learned about in this course was design patterns. Design patterns are general solutions in software design that can be reused to solve common issues. I like design patterns because they can be applied to a variety of concepts/issues: object-oriented programming, UI, testing, databases, etc. Design patterns can make finding a solution to a problem much easier. I think that this concept is especially helpful to new/junior developers because learning about design patterns can help newer developers learn about programming, for example you could get really good at object-oriented programming languages like Java and C++ by starting off learning about design patterns. By starting off with design patterns and learning about them, it will be easier to logically think about solutions to problems, and also it allows solutions to be more efficient than without design patterns. Design patterns seems similar to the coding standards concept mentioned above. I think these two concepts allow for more organization and flow of code. Additionally, they both seem to make code more efficient. But, I think that design patterns allow newer people to learn how to solve easier problems efficiently. And by learning how to efficiently and effectively solve easier problems, this type of logical thinking can be applied to harder problems.

## Ethics in Software Engineering

<br>

<br>

The last concept that I learned about in this course that struck me was ethics in Software Engineering. This module was interesting to me because I think people usually think about programming/writing code when they think about someone being a "developer", but I think there are also ethical components to being a developer. For example, AI is becoming a rapidly growing industry and while it can be very helpful to a lot of people, I think there are also some ethical concerns. I took an introductory course to AI and Machine Learning a couple years ago, and one concern that struck me, that I never necessarily thought of, was AI's ethical impact. There have been recent articles published discussing AI not understanding race and either potraying people with the wrong race or having bias towards groups of people. Additinally, AI bots has also recently been responding with threatening messages to some children telling them to end their lives. Not only is this sickening and sad, it is not ethical and super violating. Additionally, this is highly unprofessional coming from an extremely large company that should have professional tools held to very high standards. One of the last modules in this course had an ethical concern that was also highly unprofessional. In the ethics module, I read about the Privacy case study, where Google's StreetView feature had been collecting data without the users knowing and posted inappropriate pictures of people on StreetView. These people were understandably upset, but also criminals were using the StreetView feature to find and target victims. Google then proceeded to lie multiple times about collecting personal data from people, and then later announced that they had in fact collected personal data. These cases really made me reflect about ethics in software engineering and AI, but also ethics in general.
