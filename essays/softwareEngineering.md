Some concepts that I have learned from taking Software Engineering that I know will help me in future courses and beyond are: coding standards, design patterns, and ethics in software engineering. I have learned a lot throughout this semester, and this course contributed to a lot of learning... and a lot of struggle. Learning about the above three concepts was really fun and intriguing to me, but I also really liked taking Software Engineering 1 because I enjoy HTML/CSS and I had a lot of enjoyment using Bootstrap and React. I think that the flexibility to create interactive, and appealing websites/applications is very fun and I feel like I learned a lot this semester, but there is still so much more for me to learn!

Coding standards was one concept that I felt like I really enjoyed learning about because of the organization it provides. I also really liked learning about this module because I believed this can be applied outside of Software Engineering.
